# Spotify-Data-Analysis

### INTRODUCTION 
This project analyzes personal Spotify listening data to gain insights into music consumption habits and preferences. By examining factors such as play counts and listening times, I have answered the following questions :

1. What are the 10 most played artists and tracks ?
2. What are the hourly and monthly listening trends ?
3. What are the peak listening hours?
4. Which days of the week do you listen to music the most?
5. Which songs do you tend to skip most often ?
6. What is the overall skip rate ?
7. Are there any artists or tracks you've stopped listening to?
